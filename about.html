        <div id="aboutText">Hi I'm Madison! I was born and raised here in Colorado Springs and I am proud to call this city home! I have loved photography since I first took a photography class in high school. It was then that I realized a photo is like an art piece. I became obsessed with  transforming each photo to look like how I see the worldâ€”vibrant and beautiful! I saved up all my graduation money to purchase my first camera which I still use today. I have worked hard to hone in my art through composition and editing, with the goal of giving others the gift of beautiful photos!

            I recently married the love of my life and right now our family consists of a golden retriever named Cowboy and our kitty Kimberly! I am also a full-time college student studying Journalism and besides photography I spend my time reading, going on long walks, spending time with my family and friends, and working on my Spanish skills!</div>
